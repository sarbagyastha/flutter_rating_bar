## Usage

#### Using Flutter Rating Bar
Rating Bar can be used in three ways.

###### First Way:
Using itemBuilder

![First Way](images/mode1.jpg) 
```dart
RatingBar(
   initialRating: 3,
   minRating: 1,
   direction: Axis.horizontal,
   allowHalfRating: true,
   itemCount: 5,
   itemPadding: EdgeInsets.symmetric(horizontal: 4.0),
   itemBuilder: (context, _) => Icon(
     Icons.star,
     color: Colors.amber,
   ),
   onRatingUpdate: (rating) {
     print(rating);
   },
);
```

###### Second Way:
Using rating widgets

![Second Way](images/mode2.jpg) 
```dart
RatingBar(
   initialRating: 3,
   direction: Axis.horizontal,
   allowHalfRating: true,
   itemCount: 5,
   ratingWidget: RatingWidget(
     full: _image('assets/heart.png'),
     half: _image('assets/heart_half.png'),
     empty: _image('assets/heart_border.png'),
   ),
   itemPadding: EdgeInsets.symmetric(horizontal: 4.0),
   onRatingUpdate: (rating) {
     print(rating);
   },
);
```
Heart Icons are [Available Here](https://github.com/sarbagyastha/flutter_rating_bar/tree/master/example/assets).

###### Third Way:
Using item builder with index

![Third Way](images/mode3.jpg) 
```dart
RatingBar(
    initialRating: 3,
    itemCount: 5,
    itemBuilder: (context, index) {
       switch (index) {
          case 0:
             return Icon(
                Icons.sentiment_very_dissatisfied,
                color: Colors.red,
             );
          case 1:
             return Icon(
                Icons.sentiment_dissatisfied,
                color: Colors.redAccent,
             );
          case 2:
             return Icon(
                Icons.sentiment_neutral,
                color: Colors.amber,
             );
          case 3:
             return Icon(
                Icons.sentiment_satisfied,
                color: Colors.lightGreen,
             );
          case 4:
              return Icon(
                Icons.sentiment_very_satisfied,
                color: Colors.green,
              );
       }
    },
    onRatingUpdate: (rating) {
      print(rating);
    },
;
```

#### Using Flutter Rating Bar Indicator

![Indicator](images/indicator.jpg) 
```dart
RatingBarIndicator(
    rating: 2.75,
    itemBuilder: (context, index) => Icon(
         Icons.star,
         color: Colors.amber,
    ),
    itemCount: 5,
    itemSize: 50.0,
    direction: Axis.vertical,
),
```

#### Vertical Mode

In order to make the indicator scrollable, just use 'physics' property as in the [example](https://github.com/sarbagyastha/flutter_rating_bar/blob/master/example/lib/main.dart).
